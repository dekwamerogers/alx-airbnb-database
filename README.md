# Database Design Project â€“ Airbnb Clone (Frontend-Focused)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates the process of **database design and implementation** for a simplified Airbnb-like booking system.  
The focus is on:
- **Requirement Analysis**
- **Database Normalization (up to 3NF)**
- **Entity-Relationship Modeling (ERD)**
- **Schema Design using SQL**
- **Seeding the Database with Test Data**

The project was built as part of my ALX milestones to practice **solid database design principles**.
